# dna-vue

Personal influence DNA project for webdev study.

Releases should goto: https://dna.darthvid.com/

Initial version was Vue based (https://github.com/tehdarthvid/old-dna), mainly derived from https://vuejsexamples.com/parallax-depth-cards-with-vue-js/. Then I re-implemented it in ReactJS to learn React/Redux (https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-react). Then, I moved it back to VueJS/Vuex (CLI 2 stable, https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-vue-cli-2) so I can compare the two. Now, I moved it again to a VueJS/Vuex CLI 3 (beta as of typing) based project so I can compare to that too! :)

Just playing around to study web development. You'll find the code gets dirty. That's because I'll be tryin' stuff out! It gets messy, mistakes are made, then we figure it out, clean-up, and hopefully, we'll end up bein' better!

This time, I'm going to start with a blank vue-cli 3 created project so we can trace each modification I make from a common starting point.

Files in the project started from "vue create [my-project]" using vue-cli 3 configured with Vue Router, Vuex, CSS pre-processor (SASS), Lint-Formatter (ESLint + AirBnB). https://alligator.io/vuejs/using-new-vue-cli-3/ has been very helpful.
